The odin-recipes project is part of the HTML lesson in the foundation course.

In order to practice the HTML skills acquired, I have to build a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Once the website is completed, I should have demonstrated a good knowledge of html boilerplate, paragraphs, text styles, images and links.
