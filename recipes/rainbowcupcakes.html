        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package with cake mix</li>
            <li>1 â…“ cups water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>red paste food coloring</li>
            <li>orange paste food coloring</li>
            <li>yellow paste food coloring</li>
            <li>green paste food coloring</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the cake mix, water, and canola oil; continue beating for 2 minutes on medium speed.</li>
            <li>Divide the cake batter into six separate bowls. Use a toothpick to scoop a dab of food coloring into one bowl of batter and stir; add more food coloring, if necessary, to reach the desired shade. Repeat with the remaining colors and bowls of batter.</li>
            <li>Scoop spoonfuls of batter into the prepared pans, alternating the colors. Use a toothpick to gently swirl the colors for a marbled effect.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes clean, about 30-35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
